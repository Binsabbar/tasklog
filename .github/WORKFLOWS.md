# GitHub Workflows Summary

This repository uses GitHub Actions workflows with **Makefile targets** for consistency between local development and CI/CD.

## 🎯 Release Method

**There is ONE way to release: Pull Request → `releases/*` branch**

- ✅ All `releases/*` branches are **protected** (no direct pushes)
- ✅ Changes must go through **Pull Requests**
- ✅ Tests and lint **must pass** before merge
- ✅ Upon PR merge: Automatically creates **tag**, **GitHub Release**, and **Docker images**
- 🎉 **Zero manual work** - just merge the PR!

See [Complete Release Process](#complete-release-process) for step-by-step guide.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Test Workflow (`test.yaml`) 🧪

**Purpose:** Run comprehensive test suite for quality assurance

**Triggers:**

- ✅ Push to any branch (except `main`/`master`)
- ✅ Pull requests to `main`, `master`, or `releases/**` branches
- ✅ Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ Called by other workflows (`workflow_call`)

**Path Filters:**

- Runs only when Go code, workflows, or dependencies change
- Paths: `.github/workflows/**`, `**/*.go`, `**/*.mod`, `**/*.sum`

**Jobs:**

1. **setup**: Install Go and download dependencies
2. **vet**: Run `go vet` static analysis
3. **test**: Run full test suite with `make go-test` (30-minute timeout)
4. **govulncheck**: Scan for security vulnerabilities

**Environment Variables:**

- `TEST_SILENT=1`: Suppress verbose test output

---

### 2. Lint Workflow (`golangci-lint.yaml`) 🔍

**Purpose:** Enforce code quality standards

**Triggers:**

- ✅ Push to any branch (except `main`/`master`)
- ✅ Pull requests to `main`, `master`, or `releases/**` branches
- ✅ Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ Called by other workflows (`workflow_call`)

**Path Filters:**

- Same as test workflow

**Jobs:**

1. **golangci**: Run `make go-lint` with golangci-lint configuration

**Linters Enabled:**

- errcheck, staticcheck, unused, ineffassign, govet, misspell
- Configured via `.golangci.yml`

---

### 3. Snapshot Workflow (`snapshot.yaml`) 📸

**Purpose:** Build development snapshots without releasing

**Triggers:**

- ✅ Push to development branches: `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-dev` (e.g., `v1.2.3-dev`)
- ✅ Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)

**Jobs:**

1. **test**: Runs full test suite (via `workflow_call`)
2. **lint**: Runs linting (via `workflow_call`)
3. **snapshot**: Builds binaries with `make release-snapshot`

**Output:**

- Multi-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ❌ No Docker images pushed
- ❌ No GitHub releases created
- ✅ Artifacts available in workflow run

---

### 4. Release Workflow (`release.yaml`) 🚀

**Purpose:** Create official releases with binaries and Docker images via controlled PR process

**Triggers:**

- ✅ **Pull Request merged** into release branches:
  - `releases/v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` (e.g., `releases/v1.2.3`)
  - `releases/v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-rc.[0-9]+` (e.g., `releases/v1.2.3-rc.1`)
  - `releases/v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-beta.[0-9]+` (e.g., `releases/v1.2.3-beta.1`)
  - `releases/v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-alpha.[0-9]+` (e.g., `releases/v1.2.3-alpha.1`)
- ✅ Manual trigger with branch name (emergency use)

**Important:** Direct pushes to `releases/*` branches should be **disabled via branch protection** to enforce PR-based releases.

**Jobs:**

1. **test**: Runs full test suite on merge commit (via `workflow_call`)
2. **lint**: Runs linting on merge commit (via `workflow_call`)
3. **release**: After tests pass, automatically:
   - Extracts version from target branch name (e.g., `releases/v1.2.3` → `v1.2.3`)
   - Runs GoReleaser to build multi-platform binaries
   - Extracts changelog from `CHANGELOG.md`
   - **Creates Git tag automatically** (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
   - **Creates GitHub Release** with changelog and artifacts
   - Marks as pre-release for rc/beta/alpha versions
   - Builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR
   - Attaches all artifacts (binaries, checksums)

**Outputs:**

- ✅ **Git tag created automatically** (no manual tag creation!)
- ✅ GitHub Release with changelog and PR context
- ✅ Multi-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows - amd64/arm64)
- ✅ Docker images: `ghcr.io/binsabbar/tasklog:vX.Y.Z`
- ✅ Docker `:latest` tag (for stable releases only, not pre-releases)
- ✅ Checksums for verification

**Key Features:**

- 🔒 **PR-only releases**: Enforces code review before release
- 🎯 **Single release method**: One clear path to production
- 🔀 **Merge triggers release**: No manual tag creation needed
- 📝 **Audit trail**: Every release has associated PR
- 🛡️ **Protected branches**: Direct pushes blocked

# 🎉 DONE! Full audit trail via PR + automated release!

# Check the release (optional)
gh release view v1.2.3
```

**That's it! Just create a PR to a `releases/*` branch and merge it - everything happens automatically!**

### Pre-release (RC/Beta/Alpha) - **Also PR-Based!**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch for pre-release prep
git checkout -b feature/prepare-v1.2.3-rc.1

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md with RC notes
cat >> CHANGELOG.md << 'EOF'
## [1.2.3-rc.1] - 2025-01-20

### Added (Pre-release)
- Feature X for testing
EOF

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.3-rc.1"
git push origin feature/prepare-v1.2.3-rc.1

# 3. Create PR targeting releases/v1.2.3-rc.1
gh pr create \
  --base releases/v1.2.3-rc.1 \
  --head feature/prepare-v1.2.3-rc.1 \
  --title "Release v1.2.3-rc.1" \
  --body "Pre-release for testing"

# 4. Merge PR after tests pass
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch

# ✅ Upon merge, GitHub Actions AUTOMATICALLY:

#    - Creates GitHub pre-release (marked as pre-release)
#    - Pushes Docker: ghcr.io/binsabbar/tasklog:v1.2.3-rc.1
#    - Does NOT update :latest tag (only stable releases do)
```

### Development Snapshot (No Release)

```bash
# 1. Create dev branch
git checkout -b v1.2.3-dev

# 2. Make changes and push
git push origin v1.2.3-dev

# ✅ Triggers: Tests + Lint + Snapshot Build
# ❌ No release created
# ❌ No tags created
# ❌ No Docker images pushed
# 📦 Binaries available in workflow artifacts
```

## Branch Protection Setup (Required!)

To enforce the PR-based release workflow and prevent accidental direct pushes, set up branch protection:

### Step 1: Protect `releases/*` Branches

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add branch protection rule**
2. Configure:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `releases/*`
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
     - ✅ Require approvals: 1 (optional, recommended for team)
     - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - Add required checks: `test`, `golangci-lint`
   - ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
   - ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (or allow for admins only)
   - ❌ **Allow force pushes**: Disabled
   - ❌ **Allow deletions**: Disabled

3. **Save changes**

### Step 2: Protect `main`/`master` Branch (If not already protected)

1. Add another branch protection rule
2. Configure:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `main` (or `master`)
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass**: `test`, `golangci-lint`

### Result

With branch protection enabled:

- ✅ All `releases/*` changes must go through PRs
- ✅ Tests and lint must pass before merge
- ✅ Full audit trail (who approved, when merged)
- ❌ Direct pushes to `releases/*` branches blocked
- ❌ No one can bypass the workflow (including you!)
- 🎉 **Single, controlled release method!**

---

## Automated vs Manual Release

### ✅ Fully Automated Release (Recommended) - **ZERO MANUAL WORK!**

```bash
# This is ALL you need to do:
git checkout -b releases/v1.2.3
# ... update CHANGELOG.md ...
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.3"
git push origin releases/v1.2.3

# 🎉 DONE! Everything else is automatic:
# ✅ Tests run
# ✅ Tag v1.2.3 created automatically
# ✅ GitHub Release created automatically
# ✅ Docker images built and pushed automatically
# ✅ Binaries compiled for all platforms automatically
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No manual tag creation needed
- ✅ No manual GitHub Release creation needed
- ✅ No manual Docker builds needed
- ✅ Single command to trigger everything
- ✅ Impossible to forget steps
- ✅ Consistent process every time

### 🔧 Manual Release (Optional)

```bash
# If you need to re-trigger release for existing branch:
gh workflow run release.yaml -f branch=releases/v1.2.3

# Or via GitHub Actions UI:
# Actions → release → Run workflow → Enter branch → Run
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failed on Release Branch

```bash
# Fix the issue
git commit -am "fix: resolve test failures"
git push origin releases/v1.2.3

# Push again triggers workflow, which will create release when tests pass
```

### Need to Re-release

```bash
# Delete the GitHub Release first
gh release delete v1.2.3 -y

# The tag will be deleted automatically by GitHub
# OR delete manually if needed:
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3

# Push to branch again to re-trigger release
git push origin releases/v1.2.3 --force
```

### Want Different Version

```bash
# Just create a new branch with correct version
git checkout -b releases/v1.2.4
git cherry-pick <commits>
git push origin releases/v1.2.4
```

### Release Failed

```bash
# View workflow logs
gh run list --workflow=release.yaml
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Re-run manually if needed
gh workflow run release.yaml -f tag=v1.2.3 -f skip_tests=true
```
